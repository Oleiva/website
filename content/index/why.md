    headline: Multiple layouts
    text: |
      Each page is divided into components that have their own layouts. Think of it like little [Lego blocks](https://www.lego.com) that make up your site.
      You can now build completely new page layouts by assembling them from your smaller partials.

      Keeping your content free of any code empowers more users to change the content of your site. And because we chunk it all up into partials, content
      authors are able to build completely new layouts all by them self without ever touching more complex code.

      Cuttlebelle uses [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as the templating language. This makes is very convenient to build out from simple to super
      complex partials.
