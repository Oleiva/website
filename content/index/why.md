    headline: Multiple layouts
    text: |
      Each page is divided into components that have their own layouts. Think of it like little [Lego™ blocks](https://www.lego.com) that make up your
      site.

      With that you can build completely new page layouts by assembling them from your smaller partials without having to touch code.

    headline: Clean separation
    text: |
      Keeping your content free of any code empowers more users to change the content of your site. And because we chunk it all up into partials, content
      authors are able to build completely new layouts all by them self without ever touching more complex code.

      Separation also means searching through your content is easier and you can reuse layout as well as content blocks easily.

      Cuttlebelle uses [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as the templating language. This makes is very convenient to build simple partials all the way to
      super complex ones that fetch data from online APIs.
