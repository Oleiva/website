    headline: Multiple layouts
    text: |
      Each page is divided into components that have their own layouts. Think of it like little [Lego™ blocks](https://www.lego.com) that make up your
      site.

      With that you can build completely new page layouts by assembling them from your smaller partials without having to touch code.

      Keeping your content free of any code empowers more users to change the content of your site. And because we chunk it all up into partials, content
      authors are able to build completely new layouts all by them-self without ever touching more complex code.

      Separating content and code also means searching through your content is easier and you can reuse layout as well as content blocks easily.

      Cuttlebelle uses [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) as the templating language. This makes it very convenient to build simple layouts all the way to
      super complex ones that fetch data from online APIs.

      Now you can start testing your layouts with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) or any other react tester.

    headline: Secure without lock-in
    text: |
      Building static sites means only HTML, CSS and JS will be uploaded to your server. No plugins that may leave your site vulnerable to attacks.
      With Cuttlebelle you’re also not locked into any CMS and are able to move to another solution as your websites scales.

      All your content is in easy digestible markdown files and can be exported to javascript objects.
