So far Cuttlebelle is going to implement a plugin system so that you can run your own code/logic when building your sites.

Plugins could be things like:

- Multiple layouts
- Sitemap generator
- Service worker generator
- etc...

Other things that have been planned is a search engine. Because Cuttlebelles content is all in markdown and yaml files, itâ€™s straight forward to index those
files and provide an API for front end searches. Watch this space.
