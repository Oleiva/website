Cuttlebelle's watch tries hard to only render what you changed. But that can sometimes fail and it does less work than required. If you ever change something
and it doesnâ€™t appear in your browser, chances are Cuttlebelle was a bit over-eager to save time. For those cases you have the double-save.
If you save your document or your layout twice in a row, just like a double click, Cuttlebelle will render all pages for you again.

This can be really handy when adding content and developing layouts while keeping the default render time as low as possible.
