Each layout component has different requirements and the best way to learn how to use each layout that is available to you is to use Cuttlebelles automated
docs.

The homepage of the docs show you all categories. Each category can have a bunch of layouts. Categories make it easier to understand what belongs together and
finding the right one for you.

Letâ€™s pick one to see what it looks like:

look like](/assets/img/docs-component.png)

The **Example** box shows you what the layout looks like with some sample data.

The **YAML** box shows you how to use this layout in your own markdown file.

And finally there is the **HTML** box. You can click it to expand it to see what the compiled HTML would look like. This is for more advanced users.
